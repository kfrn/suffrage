## More about the 1893 petitions

Thirteen suffrage petitions circulated in 1893, of which only the largest (the Carpenter petition; 23952 signatures) survives. Not much is known about the smaller petitions, which are likely to have been compiled in specific regions. When the petitions were presented to parliament in August 1893, it was recorded that they contained the signatures of 31,872 women, almost a quarter of the voting age Pakeha female population of New Zealand. (See [_About the Petition_](https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/womens-suffrage/about-the-petition)).

The Carpenter petition is held by [Archives NZ](http://archives.govt.nz/womens-suffrage-petition) ([Archway record](https://www.archway.archives.govt.nz/ViewEntity.do?code=25903)), and is on display at the National Library of New Zealand, as part of the [He Tohu](https://natlib.govt.nz/he-tohu) permanent exhibition. The petition has been inscribed on [UNESCO's Memory of the World Register](http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/flagship-project-activities/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-8/the-1893-womens-suffrage-petition/#c183688) since 1997.

As well as the Archives NZ dataset linked above, a searchable database of signees to the Carpenter petition is available at MCH's [NZ History](https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/womens-suffrage/petition) website.
