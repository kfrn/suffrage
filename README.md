# Suffrage in New Zealand

In 1893, New Zealand became the first self-governing nation in the world to grant voting rights to women. This occurred only after many years of organisation by activists, foremost among them Kate Sheppard and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union.

From the 1880s onwards, many suffrage petitions were presented to parliament. The petitions of 1892 and 1893 have (mostly) survived, and datasets of the signees are available.

**Note** - at present, this repo is just a storehouse for my updated, cleaned-up datasets. A project using them will follow.

## Cleaned datasets

The cleaned datasets can be found in [`data/`](./data).

I did some light data cleaning on the 1892 dataset, but the 1893 dataset required a lot of toil. Read about my data cleaning process [here](./notes/data_cleaning.md).

## Source datasets

* A spreadsheet containing data from the **1892 petition(s)** has been made available by MCH [here](https://nzhistory.govt.nz/files/documents/1892-womens-suffrage-petition.xls).

* Archives NZ have made the **1893 petition data** available in spreadsheet form [here](http://archives.govt.nz/open-data).  
   * In fact, the 1893 suffrage petition was not just one petition, but many. Read my notes about that [here](./notes/1893_petitions.md).
