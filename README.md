# suffrage-petition

In 1893, New Zealand became the first self-governing nation in the world to grant voting rights to women, and therefore achieve universal suffrage. This occurred only after many years of organisation by activists, foremost among them Kate Sheppard and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. From the 1880s, many suffrage petitions were presented to parliament.

### The 1892 petitions

In 1892, eight petitions totalling over 19,000 signatures were presented to parliament. A transcript of the 1892 petition(s) has been made available by MCH [here](https://nzhistory.govt.nz/files/documents/1892-womens-suffrage-petition.xls
).

### The 1893 petitions

Thirteen suffrage petitions circulated in 1893, of which only the largest (the Carpenter petition; 23952 signatories) survives. Not much is known about the smaller petitions, which are likely to have been compiled in specific regions. When the petitions were presented to parliament in August 1893, it was recorded that they contained the signatures of 31,872 women, almost a quarter of the voting age Pakeha female population of New Zealand. (See [_About the Petition_](https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/womens-suffrage/about-the-petition)).

Archives NZ have made the petition data available [here](http://archives.govt.nz/open-data). A searchable database of signatories to the Carpenter petition is also available at MCH's [NZ History](https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/womens-suffrage/petition) website.

The Carpenter petition is held by [Archives NZ](http://archives.govt.nz/womens-suffrage-petition) ([Archway record](https://www.archway.archives.govt.nz/ViewEntity.do?code=25903)), and is on display at the National Library of New Zealand, as part of the [He Tohu](https://natlib.govt.nz/he-tohu) exhibition. The petition has been inscribed on [UNESCO's Memory of the World Register](http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/flagship-project-activities/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-8/the-1893-womens-suffrage-petition/#c183688) since 1997.
